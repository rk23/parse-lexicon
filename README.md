# PARSE-LEXICON
WDI SEA05 group project by Cynthia Wong, Derek Poppe, Reed Kinning, and Stuart Hiller

### About
Parse is a tool to help language learners read in another language and find important vocabulary to study.
The idea is backed by the Pareto Principle: *20% of the words in a text give 80% of it's understanding*.
To prove this principle, we submitted a sample text of over 15,000 words from The Count of Monte Cristo in the original
French and it actually gave us exactly 79.68% understood when 20.02% of the unique words were known. Try it yourself!
